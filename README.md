### Intrucudtion

This project employs a machine learning model to detect powdery mildew on cherry leaves, distinguishing between healthy and infected leaves. Utilizing a supervised binary classification model and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the Powdery Mildew Detector analyzes leaf images to provide accurate health assessments. The application offers a user-friendly interface for growers to identify and manage disease in cherry trees efficiently.
