### Intrucudtion

This project employs a machine learning model to detect powdery mildew on cherry leaves, distinguishing between healthy and infected leaves. Utilizing a supervised binary classification model and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the Powdery Mildew Detector analyzes leaf images to provide accurate health assessments. The application offers a user-friendly interface for growers to identify and manage disease in cherry trees efficiently.

### Dataset Content

The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains 4208 images of cherry leaves, taken from the client's crop fields. This dataset features an equal number of healthy leaves and leaves affected by powdery mildew, a biotrophic fungus that poses a significant threat to cherry crops. The images, presented against a neutral background, provide a clear view of the leaf conditions, enabling precise analysis and model training. The cherry plantation crop is a flagship product for the client, making the detection of powdery mildew crucial for maintaining product quality and market reputation.
